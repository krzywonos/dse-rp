                  <p>EVT (Edition Visualization Technology) is a software for creating and browsing digital
                     editions of manuscripts
                     			based on text encoded according to the TEI XML schemas and Guidelines. This tool
                     was born as part of the DVB (<a href="http://vbd.humnet.unipi.it/" target="blank"> Digital Vercelli Book</a>) project in order to allow the
                     			creation of a digital edition of the Vercelli Book, a parchment codex of the late
                     tenth century, now preserved in
                     			the Archivio e Biblioteca Capitolare of Vercelli and regarded as one of the four
                     most important manuscripts of the
                     			Anglo-Saxon period as regards the transmission of poetic texts in the Old English
                     language. </p>
                  <p>To ensure that it will be working on all the most recent web browsers, and for as
                     long as possible on the World
                     			Wide Web itself, EVT is built on open and standard web technologies such as HTML,
                     CSS and JavaScript. Specific
                     			features, such as the magnifying lens, are entrusted to jQuery plugins, again chosen
                     among the open source and
                     			best supported ones to reduce the risk of future incompatibilities. The general
                     architecture of the software,
                     			in any case, is modular, so that any component which may cause trouble or turn
                     out to be not completely up to
                     			the task can be replaced easily.</p>

                        INTRODUCTION
                        This is a short review of the partial edition prepared as a part of the deliverable for the Digital Scholarly Editing: Theory, Methods and Practice headed by Prof. Paola Italia, AA 2024/25 @ University of Bologna, following RIDE guidelines.
                        The partial DSE being reviewed is Rozmyślanie przemyskie, for which I would provide the following bibliographic entry:
                        <i>Rozmyślanie przemyskie, ed. by Hubert Krzywonos, Bologna, 2025. URL: krzywonos.github.io/dse-rp</i>
                        The general parameters are adequately accessible. Basic information about the project, such as the person working on it is listed in the project information subpage. No institutional information is provided, as this project is a deliverable for a specific class, and therefore not scheduled to be expanded in the future. Additionally, this also means no information provided regarding financial, temporal and personal resource made available for the project.

                        SUBJECT AND CONTENT OF THE EDITION
                        The subject of the edition is Rozmyślanie przemyskie, the first book fully written in Polish, probably in one of the Bernardine monasteries in Galicia (today’s western Ukraine, potential origin places include Lwów, Sokal, Sambor, Krystynopol) sometime after 1512. The book itself was bought by Jan Ławrowski for Biblioteka Kapituły Greckokatolickiej in Przemyśl on 3rd May 1820, and in 2005 this book has been digitised by the Polish National Library and released freely on its polona.pl service.
                        This edition contains annotated 11 out of 852 (pp. 29-39) pages of the original document, alongside the description of the manuscript and an XML-TEI file. Annotation of the document includes transliteration, a diplomatic and interpretative edition based on the previous work by the Institute of Polish Language of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and translations to five common European languages (English, Italian, German, French and Spanish).

                        AIMS AND METHODS
                        I consider the main aim of the project to be putting some spotlight on the Polish literary history abroad by presenting a part of the oldest, fully conserved text written fully in Polish. Considering there is only one manuscript and previously mentioned work done, this is a digital diplomatic edition; however, if we go by dogmatic definition on Patrick Sahle, I see no additional information that would not be possible to pe presented by print. One potential improvement would be an addition of linking between the parts of the manuscript scans and text. As this is a diplomatic edition, there are no other editorial results presented (such as stemmata, etc.), and there is no “preferred manuscript”, since there is just one copy available.
                        The edition self-hosts the digital images of the manuscript. These were downloaded from the previously mentioned polona.pl service of the Polish National Library. Each page has its own image, a JPG file of around 3MBs with 24-bit colour depth and 300dpi, which I consider adequate, but would like to be in a lossless format (this, however, is out of my reach). I do not think I should comment on the accuracy of my own work, except for the fact that I did try to make the transliteration as accurate to the original document as possible. The information regarding special capitalisation, change in weight and change of colours (namely, the red ink used for the first letter of each reading) is not encoded. I would, therefore, consider the edition to be in the middle of the editor-centric/document-centric spectrum. The project resulted in the creation of a single XML-TEI document following the TEI P5 standard. As mentioned previously, since no further work is scheduled, there is no information relating to the use of the standard for the creation of new files.

                        PUBLICATION AND PRESENTATION
                        The technologies used for this project can be divided into two different groups. The first one is the “text-based” technology group, consisting of the XML-TEI file encoded according to the TEI P5 guidelines constructed with the Oxygen XML Editor. The website has been prepared using SVT 1.3, which provides the front-end for the project, and through it’s XSLT transforms the data from the XML document regarding the manuscript for display in the browser. The XSLT configuration had to be changed, of course, but the display itself has not been changed in comparison to the default SVT 1.3 look.
                        The interface is clearly arranged and is usable without preliminary reading. The content is effectively provided through the interface. The content and the main access methods are quickly identifiable. The user is made aware of what content is currently displayed by the use of side-bar menus. However, as mentioned before, it must be noted that I have not changed the default look of SVT, as it is in my opinion made in a decent manner.
                        There is a default SVT search interface at the bottom of the right section of the webpage, which searches through the text.
                        The manuscript has a physical and content description with additional information on its origin and history, available after clicking the “ms-desc” button in the top-left section of the webpage.
                        As mentioned before, there are self-hosted images for each page, JPG files of around #MBs each, with 24-bit colour depth and 300dpi, which I consider adequate. There is no possibility for the user to change the presentation of the material.
                        The manuscript has a persistent identifier in the description in the XML-TEI document.
                        There is no technical interface available to allow for easy re-use of data. The XML-TEI document can be downloaded in the Project Information subpage. Considering that the data adheres to the TEI P5 guidelines, it would be possible to integrate it easily with other content adhering to these guidelines. 
                        The edition does not integrate with social media or any virtual research platform and has no social media presence.
                        No alternative formats of data is available for downloading and viewing.
                        The edition provides basic licence information in the Project Information subpage.
                        The edition does not have any particularly useful or unusual features meriting special attention.
